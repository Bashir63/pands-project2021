## Problem statement
    This project concerns the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set [3]. You must research the data set 
    and write documentation and code (in Python [1]) to investigate it. An online search for 
    information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated it 
    previously. You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that 
    are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed. 
    You might do that for this project as follows: 
        1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README. 
        2. Download the data set and add it to your repository. 
        3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
            •   outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file, 
            •   saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and 
            •   outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables. 
        


## Introduction :

   The Iris flower dataset is also known as the Fisher's Iris dataset. It was first introduced by Dr. Edgan Anderson, and he was explicitly credited by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher for his collection of the data. But the Iris flower dataset was named after Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher for his contribution for his published titled "The Use of Multiple Measurments in Taxonomic Problems" in 1936. In his published report, Fisher developed and evaluated a linear function to differentiate iris species based on the morphology of their flower. 

   The dataset consists of 50 sample from each of three species of iris flowers which are Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor. Among these three flowers Iris setosa's are little different in shape than the other two. But the Iris virginica and the Iris versicolor are really look a like. The dataset records the lengths and widths of sepals and petals for these flowers. As this is really difficult to identify the origin of the flower by looking at these, the only effective way is the measuring their sepals and petals in both way.
